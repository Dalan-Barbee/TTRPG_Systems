The system here will likely be converted to Python or C++, but as of the initial creation of this git, my main language is Java.
This system will be object oriented and (hopefully) mechanically flexible.

The basis of this project is as follows:

  An open ended, open source system that contains basic rules and regulations
  with the ability to incorporate up to 3 different types of modules
    
     The Modules are Properties, World, and Story.
      
      Properties contains information about the game such as prebuilt spells, weapons, armor, creatures, and more. 
      This is all hard-coded logic within the specific version of the game being run.
      
      World contains information about the world of the game. This includes maps, layouts, biomes, blueprints, terrians, etc.
      These are used to show the world around the characters.
      
      Story contains information about NPCs, relationships, lore, and plot.
      These rely on specific worlds and can be combined for parallel story.
      
 Each of these modules will have a new, prebuilt format for each that is taken in by the system to be incorporated for use.
 
 
 Some systems will be hard-coded into the base system (such as gravity, basic chemistry, rules about magic, etc.)
 These can be overridden or bent for use, and as such as built rigidly.
